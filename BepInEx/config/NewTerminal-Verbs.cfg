# Default value: SNARE FLEA\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 30%\n\nScientific name: Dolus-scolopendra. \nA very large arthropod of the class chilopoda. Its body produces a silk which it primarily uses to propel itself to places where it is concealed. Its exoskeleton is somewhat fragile, and they can die from long falls. The snare flea does not produce venom, nor does it have a strong bite. It makes up for this weakness with its ability to tighten itself around large prey to suffocate.\n\nThe snare flea thrives in dark, warm areas. It cannot survive low temperatures and generally avoids open air and sunlight take the rats outside or just beat the hell otu of them! i think their insides could make a good milkshake,,\n\n
Snare flea = 跳蚤虫\n\n西格德尔的危险程度： 30%\n\n学名：Dolus-scolopendra. \n一种非常大的节肢动物，属于蛛形纲。它的身体会产生一种丝，主要用来把自己推进到隐蔽的地方。它的外骨骼有些脆弱，长时间坠落会摔死。跳蚤虫不产生毒液，咬合力也不强。它能将自己紧紧缠住大型猎物使其窒息，从而弥补了这一弱点。\n\n跳蚤虫在阴暗、温暖的地方生长。它无法在低温下生存，一般避免露天和阳光照射，把跳蚤虫带到外面或直接把它们打得落花流水！我觉得它们的内脏可以做成很好的奶昔、\n\n

# Default value: Bracken -- AKA flower man!\n\nit was flower man, you can\'t say othrwise! i wanted to find his body .You were the cowards\n\nScientific name: Rapax-folium\nThere is debate on the genus to which the Bracken belongs. It is a bipedal vertebrate with skin the color and texture of a red beat. The name was coined for what appear to be leaves protruding from its upper spine. The purpose of these is believed to be for intimidation, however not much is known about the specifics of bracken behaviour due to its illusiveness and low population.\n\nWe know a little from accounts by wildlife experts who have encountered it. is a lone hunter with high intelligence. Its behavior can seem aloof; it exhibits high aggression even when unprovoked, yet it quickly backs off when confronted. However, brackens are known to up their hostility when cornered or simply watched for a long time. For this reason it\'s recommended to keep an eye on it but not to stare it down. No specimens have been collected dead or alive. It\'s theorized that upon death their bodies undergo a rapid decomposition process which is unique from other large animals.\n\n
Bracken = 黑影 -- 又名 "花人"！\n\n我想找到他的尸体，你们才是懦夫。\n\n学名： Rapax-folium\n关于腕足动物属于哪一属还存在争议。它是一种两足脊椎动物，皮肤的颜色和质地像红拍子。它的名字是因为它的上脊柱上似乎有一些突出的叶子。据说这些叶子的作用是为了恐吓，但由于蕨类植物的模糊性和数量较少，人们对其行为的具体细节知之甚少。\n\n我们从遇到过它的野生动物专家的描述中略知一二。它的行为看起来很冷漠；即使在无缘无故的情况下，它也会表现出很强的攻击性，但当面对它时，它又会很快退却。不过，众所周知，蕨类植物在被逼到墙角或被长时间监视时会提高敌意。因此，我们建议密切关注它，但不要盯着它看。没有采集到死的或活的标本 据推测，它们死后尸体会迅速腐烂 这是其他大型动物所没有的\n\n

# Default value: HOARDING BUG\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 0%\n\nScientific name: Linepithema-crassus\nHoarding bugs (of the order Hymenoptera) are large, social insects. While often found living alone, they have been found to share their nests with members of their own species. They measure a height of 3 feet on average, with bulbous bodies. The thinness of their fluid and blood and the material of their carapaces contributes to their low weight, making them capable of flight with their membranous wings. It also makes their bodies somewhat transparent.\n\nHoarding bugs were given their name due to their territorial nature. Once they have chosen a place as their nest, they will seek to adorn it with any object they can find and will protect these objects as a part of the nest. Hoarding bugs are not so dangerous alone as they are in large hives. However, if left alone, hoarding bugs are surprisingly neutral and pose little danger. wWe love the stupid cuddle bugs.!! - tjhis has been a note from the indomitable Sigurd
Hoarding bug = 囤积虫\n\n西格德尔的危险程度： 0%\n\n学名： Linepithema-crassus\n囤积虫（膜翅目）是一种大型社会性昆虫。虽然它们经常独居，但也发现它们与同类共享巢穴。它们平均身高 3 英尺，身体呈球状。它们的体液、血液和甲壳材料都很稀薄，因此重量很轻，能够用膜质翅膀飞行。这也使它们的身体有些透明。\n\n囤积虫之所以被称为囤积虫，是因为它们有领地意识。一旦它们选择了一个地方作为自己的巢穴，就会想方设法用它们能找到的任何物品来装饰它，并将这些物品作为巢穴的一部分加以保护。囤积虫单独行动时并不如在大型巢穴中那么危险。不过，如果不管他们，囤积虫会出奇地保持中立，几乎不会造成危险！- 这是不屈不挠的西格德尔的留言

# Default value: HYGRODERE\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 0%, if you\'re faster than a snail!\n\nScientific name: Hygrodere \nA eukaryotic organism classified within the paraphyletic group Prostita. With the incredible speed of reproduction, these small organisms can multiply to millions. Hygrodere rarely split apart, instead choosing to form large, viscous masses which can take up large amounts of space and become a danger to deal with, requiring large tools or lures to relocate.\n\nHygrodere are drawn to heat and oxygen and can detect it from seemingly anywhere. There\'s almost nothing organic they can\'t convert to their own body mass. Nothing has been found to poison them. Constantly replacing themselves, they can persist for hundreds of thousands of years. If you ever find yourself cornered, find a tall object to stand on top of; hygroderes have trouble climbing. they have great taste! cause I made a friend with one somehow,, and we think it was my music. \n
Hygrodere = 史莱姆\n\n西格德尔的危险程度： 0%, 如果你比蜗牛还快的话\n\n学名： Hygrodere \n一种真核生物，被归类为婊形目（Prostita）旁门类。由于繁殖速度惊人，这些小生物可以繁殖到数百万。水螅很少分裂，而是形成粘稠的大块，会占据大量空间，成为处理的危险因素，需要大型工具或诱饵才能转移。\n\n它们被热量和氧气吸引 可以从任何地方探测到热量和氧气 几乎没有什么有机物，它们不能转化成自己的体质，没有任何东西能毒害它们，而且它们不断地自我更新，可以存活几十万年。如果你发现自己走投无路，可以找一个高大的物体站在上面；史莱姆不会攀爬。它们的品味很好！因为我不知怎么交到了一个史莱姆朋友，我认为那是我放的音乐导致的。\n

# Default value: Thumpers\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 90%\n\nScientific name: Pistris-saevus\nHalves, or Thumpers, are a highly aggressive, carnivorous species of the order Chondrichthyes. Their skeletons are cartilaginous, giving their bodies a stretchy and rubbery quality. Their name comes from the fact they must eat their bottom legs in order to escape the shell of their hatched egg; their bottom legs are hardly functional to begin with. Their arms, or front legs, are very strong, and they occasionally use them to stomp prey. They can reach great speeds in a straight line.\n\nThey are relentless hunters, typically at the top of their food chain. Their main weaknesses are their intelligence and complete lack of hearing. If you come across a thumper, your best means of survival are leaving its line of sight, as it is slower around corners and can\'t easily track prey.\n\nDue to the fast and volatile evolution of this species, some theorize that thumpers are one of the examples of an increased number of mutations causing higher levels of speciation in planets around the Thistle Nebula.
Thumper = 半身鱼\n\n西格德尔的危险程度： 90%\n\n学名： Pistris-saevus\n半身鱼或怦鱼是软骨鱼纲中一种极具攻击性的肉食性鱼类。它们的骨骼是软骨质的，因此身体具有弹性和橡胶质感。它们的名字来源于这样一个事实，即它们必须吃掉自己的下肢才能逃出孵化卵的外壳；它们的下肢本来就没有什么功能。它们的手臂或前肢非常强壮，偶尔会用来踩踏猎物。它们在直线上可以达到很高的速度。\n\n它们是无情的猎手，通常处于食物链的顶端。它们的主要弱点是智力低下和完全没有听力。如果你遇到半身鱼，你最好的生存手段就是离开它的视线，因为它在转弯时速度较慢，而且不容易追踪猎物。\n\n由于这一物种的进化速度快且不稳定，一些人推测，半身鱼是 Thistle 星云周围行星变异数量增加导致物种分化水平提高的例子之一。

It\'s a popular myth that they often mistake the sounds of their own kind for prey, entering fights within their own packs.\n\nTheir behaviour is unique from other pack animals in their tendency to spread out far to cover distance. When an eyeless dog has found prey, it roars to alert others in the near vicinity, who will also sound the alarm, sometimes resulting in a kind of chain reaction. Eyeless dogs can be dangerous in swarms. However, they are characteristically clumsy, taking guesses at their prey\'s exact location which are often incorrect. 
EyelessDog = 无眼犬\n\n学名： Leo caecus\n一种属于 Saeptivus 类的大型哺乳动物。它们是群居动物，成群结队地狩猎 它们也被称为 "会呼吸的狮子"，因为它们的声音很好辨认，而且嘴巴很大。它们是耐力型猎手，并试图用听觉来弥补视觉上的不足。一个流行的说法是，它们经常把同类的声音误认为是猎物，在自己的族群里大打出手\n\n与其他群居动物相比，无眼犬的行为方式很特别，它们倾向于分散开来，以拉开距离。当无眼犬发现猎物时，它会发出吼叫声，提醒附近的其他动物，这些动物也会发出警报声，有时会产生一种连锁反应。无眼犬成群时可能很危险。然而，它们的笨拙是它们的特点，猜测猎物的确切位置往往是错误的。

# Default value: FOREST KEEPER\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 50%\n\nScientific name: Satyrid-proceritas\nBelieved to share a common ancestor with rapax-folium, these behemoths are called Forest Keepers for the biomes they often inhabit. Their bodies bare markings on their front and back which mimic eyes--this trait is more helpful in their youth, as they are not agile. Their skin is a unique, dense material which hardens further throughout their lives; the large spikes and bumps across their bodies form as a result of aging.\n\nIt\'s been said Forest Keepers exhibit a curious behavior similar to that of a human child the age of 5 or 6. They will eat anything they find fascinating. Forest Keepers don\'t actually need to put anything into their mouths, and it\'s theorized their main source of energy is a process similar to photosynthesis. Still, this makes them relatively dangerous to observe. They can see across long distances, so staying low and making use of cover is a must. They cannot enter small spaces and are not generally destructive, so stay close to shelter or overhangs.
ForestGiant = 森林守护者\n\n西格德尔的危险程度： 50%\n\n学名： Satyrid-proceritas\n这些庞然大物被认为与雷帕克斯-弗利姆（rapax-folium）有着共同的祖先，因其经常栖息在生物群落中而被称为森林守护者。它们的身体前后都有模仿眼睛的斑纹--这种特征在它们年轻时更有用，因为它们并不敏捷。它们的皮肤是一种独特的致密材料，在它们的一生中会进一步变硬；它们身体上的大型尖刺和凸起是衰老的结果。\n\n据说森林守护者表现出的好奇行为类似于人类五六岁的孩子。他们会吃任何他们觉得有趣的东西 守林人实际上不需要把任何东西放进嘴里 它们的主要能量来源据说是一种类似光合作用的过程 尽管如此 这还是让它们的观察变得相对危险 它们能看到很远的距离，所以必须保持低姿势并利用掩体。它们无法进入狭小的空间，一般也不具有破坏性，因此要靠近遮蔽物或悬崖。

None have been captured, so not much is known of their biology. \n\nThey seem to behave as predators. It\'s speculated they can burrow as far as 40 meters underground, judging by the incredible excavations they can leave behind. They can detect even the slightest vibrations, and for this reason it\'s not recommended to stay still if they are nearby; that is a myth. Instead, if you hear them burrowing, retrace your steps.

# Default value: COIL-HEADS\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 80%\n\nScientific name: Vir colligerus\nVir colligerus, or colloquially named Coil-heads, have not been studied extensively due to their extreme unpredictability and dangerous properties. They have been known to combust into flames when being dissected or even deactivated, and they carry dangerously high levels of radioactive particles. Due to this and other reasons, it has been highly speculated they were created as biological weapons of war, although this has not been proven.\n\nCoil-heads\' visual appearance is that of a bloody mannequin with its head connected by a spring. Their defining behavioral characteristic is to stop when being looked at. However, this does not appear to be a hard-and-fast rule. When they encounter a loud or bright light they sometimes appear to enter a long reset mode. \nJust stare at htem or use a stun grenade! - Sigurd\n\n

# Default value: Spore lizard\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: i ,dont know probably 5% i just hate this pudgy legged little sh it\n\nScientific name: Lacerta-glomerorum\nColloquially named puffers or spore lizards, Lacerta-glomerorum (of the family Alligatoridae) is one of the largest and heaviest reptiles. Despite their large mouths, they are herbivores and do not have a strong bite. The bulbs on their tails are believed to secrete a chemical which attracts and accelerates the growth of the fungus species Lycoperdon perlatum, which it can then shake to release spores as a defense mechanism--an unique example of a mutualistic symbiotic relationship.\n\nSpore lizards have a very timid temperment, tending to avoid all confrontation if possible. If their attempts at threat display are not effective, they may attempt to attack, so it\'s not recommended to corner or chase one. There are historical records that spore lizards were at least partially domesticated hundreds of years ago, however this effort was set aside by an initiative to harvest their tails for their medicinal properties.
Puffer = 孢子蜥蜴\n\n西格德尔的危险程度： 我不知道，可能有 5% 吧，我只是讨厌这个小胖子。\n\n学名： Lacerta-glomerorum\nLacerta-glomerorum（鳄科）俗称河鲀或孢子蜥蜴，是最大、最重的爬行动物之一。尽管嘴巴很大，但它们是草食动物，咬合力不强。据说它们尾巴上的球茎能分泌一种化学物质，吸引并加速真菌物种 Lycoperdon perlatum 的生长，然后摇动真菌释放孢子作为一种防御机制--这是互利共生关系的一个独特例子。\n\n孢子蜥蜴的脾气非常胆小，如果可能，它们倾向于避免一切对抗。如果它们展示威胁的尝试无效，它们可能会试图攻击，所以不建议把它们逼到角落或追逐它们。据史料记载，孢子蜥蜴至少在几百年前被部分驯化过，不过当时是为了采摘它们的尾巴作为药材。

# Default value: Bunker spiders\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 20%\n\nScientific name: Mutinum-ficedula\nBunker spiders, of the genus Theraphosa, are the largest arachnid found in the Thistle Nebula and the second largest ever discovered. It\'s believed they evolved to prey on large mammals over the course of a measly several hundred years after the Boat made its trip around the Thistle Nebula. (Refer to: Speculation on Increased Speciation Around the Fading Nebulae)\n\nBunker spiders produce silk and lay it around their chosen nesting area, then wait for it to be tripped on. They can be seen waiting on walls, often over doorways where prey could enter unaware. If you find a bunker spider \'unprepared\' it may freeze as a defensive reaction. In this case they are best left alone. If a bunker spider reacts aggressively, it is best not to fight with ordinary tools. They use their webs to make up for their rather slow movement, so take note of your surroundings. Their webs can be broken easily with any blunt tool.\n\nBunker spiders can pose a great danger to humans and urban explorers especially, without a great benefit to their ecosystems. A resulting kill-on-sight order has been informally agreed upon between many states home to the Bunker spider, and it is currently approved by the ITDA as of 10/6/2497.
BunkerSpider = 地穴蜘蛛\n\n西格德尔的危险程度： 20%\n\n学名： Mutinum-ficedula\n地穴蜘蛛是蓟马星云中发现的最大的蛛形纲动物，也是迄今为止发现的第二大蛛形纲动物。人们认为它们是在“船”环绕蓟花星云航行后短短几百年的时间里进化出来捕食大型哺乳动物的。(参考：关于消逝星云周围物种增加的推测）\n\n地堡蜘蛛生产蛛丝，并将其铺设在选定的筑巢区域周围，然后等待被绊倒。人们可以看到它们在墙壁上等待，通常是在猎物可能不经意进入的门口。如果你发现一只地穴蜘蛛（"未察觉状态"），它可能会因为防御反应而僵住。在这种情况下，最好不要打扰它们。如果地穴蜘蛛有攻击性反应，最好不要用普通工具与之搏斗。它们用蜘蛛网来弥补行动迟缓的缺陷，所以要注意周围的环境。它们的网可以用任何钝器轻易打破。\n\n地穴蜘蛛会给人类，尤其是城市探险者带来极大的危险，却不会给其生态系统带来很大的益处。因此，许多邦克蜘蛛栖息地的州之间非正式地达成了一项 "格杀勿论 "的命令，该命令目前已获得 ITDA 的批准（截至 10/6/2497）。

# Default value: Manticoils\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 0%\n\nScientific name: Quadrupes-manta\nMantacoils are a passerine bird of the family corvidae. Their bodies are quite large compared to their early descendants, and their wingspan ranges from 55 to 64 inches. Their most defining characteristic is their set of four wings. Their back wings are mostly used to stabilize when at low speed, while their front two wings create the majority of lift. Their round bodies are a striking yellow but with black outlines or stripes along their primary (rear) feathers.\n\nManticoils mostly feed on small insects but can also feed on small rodents. They are highly intelligent and social. They pose little threat and have a generally passive temperament towards humans, although they are capable of transmitting Rabies, Rubenchloria, and Pitt Virus.\n\n

# Default value: Circuit Bees\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 90%\n\nScientific name: Crabro-coruscus\nThe circuit bee, also known as red bee, is a eusocial flying insect of the genus Apis, a descendent of the honey bee. Their appearance is quite recognizable from their hairy, red bodies and two sets of wings. Like their ancestors, they are well-known for their intelligent social BEEhavior, large colony size, building wax nests which they use to store honey, and their important role in pollination. Unlike the honey bee, which often chose high places such as trees to construct its hive, red bees create their hives on the ground.\n\nRed bees are highly defensive. They will leave the nest to attack any creature that comes within several meters, leaving BEEhind only the queen and drone bees. This bold BEEhavior is enabled by their most defining aBEElity, which is their electrostatic charge. Red bees produce friction with the air. They also produce friction by rubbing their two pairs of wings against each other and by rubbing against one another while in the hive. What allows them to create such a surplus of electric field compared to the honey bee is still under research, as they generate a stronger electric field when panicked or angered. This ability is especially useful for them around water.\n\n\n\nIt\'s BEEst to keep your distance. If a red bee hive is stolen, red bee swarms will enter an onslaught in which they attack any living creature. This destructive BEEhavior will last until they have located the hive or completely exhausted themselves, which can take hours to days. They have BEEn known to leave BEEhind fields of bodies of small rodents, insects and even some larger mammals, and in rare cases they can start fires. Their strong BEEnefits and drawbacks to their ecosystems are highly debated. BEEbated !! - the indomitable Sigurd

# Default value: Baboon hawk\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 75%\n\nScientific name: Papio-volturius\nBaboon hawks are a primate of the family Cercopithecidae. They are hunchbacked but can stand up to 8 feet on average. Their heads are boney, with bird-like beaks and long horns, which they use like skewers to gore and feed on prey. Their horns are made of keratin instead of bone like the rest of their skulls, and they do not contain nerves or blood vessels. As a result baboon hawks can often break their horns from the force they apply, then fully regrow them within the same season. Baboon hawks partly owe their name to their large wings, which could never carry their large body mass and are used instead for intimidation and protection from the elements.\n\nThe largest baboon hawk troop ever observed was made up of 18 baboon hawks. They are loosely territorial, and much of their behavior is motivated by intimidation and display. They can become collectors, using any flashy or colorful object to mark their territory. As lone scouts, baboon hawks are generally timid and won\'t attack unless provoked. In greater numbers they can become a great danger; sticking close to others and making yourself seem dangerous are the best ways to prevent an attack. They prefer smaller mammals, but when desperate they are known to use their numbers to attack animals even twice their size, such as eyeless dogs. THEY TOOK M Y PICKLES\n\n

I couldnt find a way to do the most basic thing on this old janky butt computer so I had Desmond add it in, the log feature. til now ive just been adding my own notes to the bestiary whatever i know. My brother said i should keep a journal so im doing what i can! I am writing in a proffessional manner, as these logs could become a historical record, as they will projbably be here for years, just as long as there isnt a clean wipe. that is what desmond saidfd\n\n\nIf you are reading it in the future, you are probably from a nother crew. The turnover rate here is enormous, maybe cause this job sucks and every one turns over dead! Maybe I can give some help when I have some expirience.

LogFile1Keyword = 日期： 1968 年 8 月 22 日\n你好。我写这篇日志是为了让自己保持清醒。我找不到办法在这台老旧的电脑上做最基本的事情，所以我让 Desmond 帮我加上了日志功能。我哥哥说我应该写日记，所以我就尽我所能！我写得很专业，因为这些日志可能会成为历史记录，因为它们可能会在这里存在很多年，只要没有被清除掉。\n\n\n如果你将来读到这篇文章，你可能来自另一个团队。这里的人员流动率非常高，也许是因为这份工作太烂了，每个人都死掉了！等我有经验了，也许能帮上忙。日志结束。\n我们的名字是 西格德尔（我） 理查德 德斯蒙德 杰西\n\n
